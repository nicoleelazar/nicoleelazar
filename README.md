## Hi, Im Nicole ðŸ‘‹

The projects youâ€™ll find here are from my early days as a developer â€” around five years ago â€” when I was still learning and experimenting with new tools and concepts.

While theyâ€™re not a reflection of how I write code now, Iâ€™ve kept a small selection of them public because they still show interesting code and ideas, and give a snapshot of where I started. I had fun making these [short games](https://game-collection.netlify.app).

Since then, Iâ€™ve been working as a front-end developer, mainly in fintech, building complex, data-driven interfaces that deliver clean and engaging user experiences.

My current tech stack includes React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MUI, and Figma.
